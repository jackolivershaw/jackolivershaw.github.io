	<p>I am broadly interested in understanding evolutionary patterns in the fossil record and their links with extinction events. In particular, I am fascinated by sexual selection, and when, how, and why it evolved. I am also interested in the effects of hyperthermal activity on planktonic foraminifera, and how such events affect the isotopic composition of foraminiferal tests.</p>
