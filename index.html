	<p>I am broadly interested in how community structure has changed through deep time and in response to perturbations, such as climate change.</p>
	<p>Much of my recent work has focused on applying new quantitative analytical techniques--such as machine learning and network analysis approaches--to the fossil record to disentangle ecological and taphonomic signals. By accounting for biases in the fossil record we are able to draw more robust inferences of paleoecological dynamics. A better understanding of these dynamics is vital for evaluating future biotic responses to global change.</p>
