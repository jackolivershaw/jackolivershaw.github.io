	<p>I am broadly interested in how ecological diversity, biotic interactions, and community structure have changed through deep time and in response to perturbations, such as climate change. Much of my recent work has focused on applying new quantitative analytical techniques--such as machine learning and network analysis approaches--to the fossil record to disentangle ecological and taphonomic signals. By accounting for biases in the fossil record we are able to draw more robust inferences of paleoecological dynamics. A better understanding of these dynamics is vital for evaluating future biotic responses to global change. Ongoing works involves elucidating the importance of trophic and competitive interactions in driving macroevolutionary dynamics.</p>
