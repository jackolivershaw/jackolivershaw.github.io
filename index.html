	<p>I am broadly interested in how community structure has changed through deep time and in response to perturbations, such as climate change. Much of my recent work has focused on applying new quantitative analytical techniques--such as machine learning and network analysis approaches--to the fossil record to disentangle ecological and taphonomic signals. By accounting for biases in the fossil record we are able to draw more robust inferences of paleoecological dynamics. A better understanding of these dynamics is vital for evaluating future biotic responses to global change.</p>
	<p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about increasing accessibility to educational opportunities. Back in 2012 I took part in a Fulbright-led social mobility program aiming to support underrepresented groups in securing admission and financial support at US colleges. Through the program--and resultant experiences as a college student in the US--I developed a keen interest in increasing diversity and inclusivity in the undergraduate and graduate admissions process. Feel free to drop me an email if I can help you out in any way.</p>
